# Workspaces Enhancer Nvim

This plug-in is an enhancement of [workspace.nvim](https://github.com/natecraddock/workspaces.nvim). It can automatically record and open the buffer of the last access of the current workspace, and it supports opening multiple workspaces. When you enter the buffer of different workspaces, the plug-in will automatically switch cwd to the workspace of entered buffer.

# Installation

```lua
